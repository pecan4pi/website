So you've made it here, my first published website! Welcome, my name is pecan4 and I am the creator of this page. I would offer you something to drink, but I don't think you can do that on a website. <br>
 You know I'm really using the word "website" to much. I think I'll stop here and see if I can even upload this.

I have to give you a warning; this is going to be super chaotic because I'm going to be putting <i>all</i> the html commands I know into this. If you leave now, thats fine.

 <p> i figured out how to make subdirectories! It might not work with github though... I really hope it does though! <br>

 Heres the (test) link: <a href=https://pecan4pi.github.io/website/test-subdiretory.html>will it work?</a>
